“I think it’s great people are nostalgic for things in the past, maybe for good reason. It happens,” she says on “The Breakfast Club” Thursday, March 22, “But for me, I always tried to be honest and said that if my film and television career had been a lot better, I might not have any problem dipping my toe back in to that water and going and doing the Max character."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It happens,” she says on “The Breakfast Club” Thursday, March 22, “But for me, I always tried to be honest and said that if my film and television career had been a lot better, I might not have any problem dipping my toe back in to that water and going and doing the Max character. But for me … time is so finite. You have so little time. I think I just want to see if I can do other things. And see if I can get people as happy for me or into a different character in a different way.”</p><p>Alexander added that while she’ll “never say never,” as a child of orphans and a deceased&nbsp;father, she knows that tomorrow is not promised.</p><p>The actress, who comes from a dramatic background, played the comedic lawyer for six seasons on “Living Single,” which ran from 1993 to 1998. Last year, Queen Latifah, who played Flavor magazine publisher and editor&nbsp;Khadijah James, said a <a href=# rel=noopener>reboot </a>was in the works.</p><p>“We’re actually working on it,” she said on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.” “It’s not there yet. But, hopefully, we can get it happening.”</p><p>She said the goal would be to talk to the original cast that was involved, but Alexander confirmed everyone’s favorite attorney at law won’t be included.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX55e49sZmtqX6G2t7XNoGSsoZ6cuaZ50Z6ZqKekYsSwutNmoKebnKqxprCMppixoZ6aerS0wLBkmqykpL%2Bvsdhmo5qvXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
