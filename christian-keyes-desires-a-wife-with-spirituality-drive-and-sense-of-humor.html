Keyes would begin with a bouquet of flowers, followed by a romantic dinner. He’d then take his girlfriend to a concert, after which they’d go out for dessert and then back to his place.</p><p>When asked what kind of woman he would choose for a date, the Saints and Sinners actor listed three major qualities he looks for in a woman: spirituality, drive, and a sense of humor. Keyes explained why he wants his partner to be driven and ambitious after a brief discussion about the importance of spirituality. He wants her to be self-sufficient and believes she will be fine without him.</p><p>Keyes wants his partner to be the same way he is when he’s not working because he is such a playful soul when he’s not working.</p><h2>Wedding Preparations</h2><p>The In Contempt actor appears to be single right now, but he hopes to marry someday. In a May 2018 interview with The Rolling Out, he discussed it. When asked why he hadn’t married despite having a grown-up son, Keyes reiterated his desire for a wife, claiming he was financially stable to marry and start a family.</p><p>The Detroit native expressed his desire to have more children and adopt at least one child, ideally with a loving wife. Returning to the topic of the ideal partner, Keyes stated that his wife would have to dress properly and be able to speak up for herself. To sit beside him, she’d have to bring her own table.</p><h2>Keyes Would Like to Adopt a Child</h2><p>Christian Keyes Jr. is Keyes’ son (born December 2002.) Even though he hasn’t revealed anything about the Christian’s mother to date, their bond is quite strong. For the actor, having one son is insufficient.
