Jackson Mahomes, Patrick’s younger brother, is definitely able to attest to this. Despite the difficulties, Jackson Mahomes has become a social media celebrity without Patrick’s help, amassing more than a million followers on <a href=#>TikTok</a> and Instagram.</p><p>Recently, a video of Jackson dousing a Baltimore Ravens fan with water went viral, and Patrick defended Jackson. When the incident took place, the Ravens had recently defeated Patrick’s Chiefs 36–35. There was a lot of debate concerning Jackson Mahomes’ <a href=#>sexual orientation</a> as soon as he gained notoriety.</p><h3>Jackson Mahomes Says “He’s Attracted to Girls and is Not Gay”</h3><p>In his first YouTube video, Jackson Mahomes made it plain that he is not gay and has feelings for women. He claimed that a lot of people have doubts about him because of his voice and his dancing on TikTok. Jackson responded, “I am not gay, I am drawn to girls, and I think it is a really nasty question.</p><p>The main reason why people assume he is gay, according to Jackson, is because of his voice. “I think it’s sort of incredibly insulting to judge someone based on what they choose.”</p><p>visit this Instagram post</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Jackson Mahomes (@jacksonmahomes)</a></p><p><br>He claimed that his voice is his major concern:</p><p>“My voice is my worst weakness. I detest listening to my voice. I had so much backlash for it. I am constantly criticised for my voice. When I start chatting, everyone immediately asks, “Are you gay? ’”</p><h3>Most Questions Surrounding Mahomes’ S*xuality Are Hateful Comments</h3><p>Jackson Mahomes attracts a lot of criticism, particularly from those who cast doubt on his sexuality. When people chat about him online, he pays attention, but he doesn’t answer. I cherish the wonderful supporters, the decent individuals, and the fans who love me for me, Jackson continued, adding that “I only look at the positives.”</p><p>According to Patrick Mahomes, the Ravens fan yelled something nasty that was not captured on camera in the video of Jackson dousing him with water. After a while, he’d undoubtedly had enough of the vitriol flung at him. What Patrick said was as follows:</p><p>“It’s obviously something we don’t necessarily want to do. There were remarks made to him and Brittany that are not shown in the video. Brittany Matthews is Patrick’s fiance. He’s done an excellent job of attempting to ignore that stuff. He takes a lot, is typically really good at it, learns from it, and does his best to avoid those folks.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
