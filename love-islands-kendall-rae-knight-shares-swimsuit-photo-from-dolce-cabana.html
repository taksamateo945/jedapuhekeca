In a new social media post the Love Island beauty shows off her amazing body in a swimsuit while vacationing at the City of Dreams Mediterranean resort. "Dolce & Cabana," she captioned the series of Instagram snaps. "Stunning," commented one of her followers. "Absolutely gorgeous I can't cope with you," added another. How does the reality star approach health and wellness? Celebwell rounded up some of her top lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/shutterstock_427691446.jpg><p><span>Kendall told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Glamour UK</span></a><span> that she felt pressured into getting Botox after being told she was "old looking" during a photo shoot. "I was on a shoot – I won't say what for – but the photographer and the client who had booked me were sat at the laptop screen and kept saying over and over again: 'she's quite old, we will have to airbrush her around her eyes, we maybe needed someone with a fresher face', so I did actually go out and get Botox," she said. "It will wear off so I'm not bothered but I don't think I would get anything permanent; I think I would be a bit stronger now."</span></p><p><span>Kendall confessed that her diet "isn't the best" to Glamour UK. "I just eat a little bit of anything I want. I have a real sweet tooth," she said.</span></p><p><span>Kendall loves burning calories while on vacation. During a recent vacation in Ibiza, she went paddleboarding. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The American Council on Exercise</span></a><span> (ACE) agrees that paddle boarding is great for the core and also a great form of cardio. The water sport can burn an average of 385 calories for a 140 pound male and 436 for a female the same size, per a study conducted by Arizona State University.</span></p><p><span>Kendall understands the importance of hydration. Here she is drinking out of a coconut. According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>, hydration is important for a variety of reasons. Water helps get rid of waste through urination, perspiration, and bowel movements, keeps your temperature normal, lubricates and cushions joints, and helps protect sensitive tissues.</span></p><p><span>Oral hygiene is important to Kendall. She explained to Glamour UK that while she has been accused of having veneers, her bright whites are the result of her routine. "I just use a gel from my dentist to keep them looking white, and I brush twice a day."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK271Z5koquclrulv4yknKeckaG5br7AnmSkppmctbV50qGYq52jYsC4tcysrKKsXaW1sMDOZp2rp51isbC4wp5knJmSlruiew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
