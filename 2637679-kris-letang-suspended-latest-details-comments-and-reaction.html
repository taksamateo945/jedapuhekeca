Just some issues with my neck right now," he said after the game, per ESPN.com's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pierre LeBrun</a>. "I just got hit right in the head and a little whiplash I think. It is what it is."</p><p>According to the Washington Post's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Isabelle Khurshudyan</a>, though, Johansson missed Washington's practice Tuesday, and the team <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> he has an upper-body injury.</p><p>Letang, for his part, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told reporters</a> Wednesday he "respects" the decision to suspend him, but added there was "no malicious intention."</p><p>Losing Johansson for Game 4 would be a blow for the Capitals. He has seven points (two goals, five assists) in nine playoff games, and he collected 46 points (17 goals, 29 assists) in the regular season.</p><p>But even if Johansson is out, the Penguins will likely miss Letang more. Puck Daddy's Greg Wyshynski noted how much Pittsburgh struggled without him this year:</p>Greg Wyshynski <span class=acct>@wyshynski</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>There we go. Again, Pens were 2-8-1 without Letang in the regular season. https://t.co/9rKx0BHWOT</p><p>Letang's effectiveness on both ends of the ice makes him one of the Penguins' most important players. Losing him at any stage of the year would be a big deal, and his absence will be magnified given the stakes of Pittsburgh's next game.</p><p>Taking a 3-1 series lead would put the Penguins firmly in the driver's seat. But now the Capitals have a much better chance to even things up and steal a game on the road with Pittsburgh down a key man.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9rZ2uEennKq6CsZZyawaK6xmaqrqugmrulscNmo5qslajBbrDErZiipKNisLC5zJ6lratdlruledGemJysmaS7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
