They made their relationship public for the first time in May, on Marchena’s birthday, by uploading a photo of themselves together.&nbsp;Marchena and Soler are completely smitten.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Marta-Marchena-1.jpg alt="Marta Marchena" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Following Soler’s transfer to PSG, she got abusive and disrespectful remarks.</h2><p>Soler, who was born in Valencia, began his youth career with Valencia before joining the reserve squad in 2015. In December 2016, he was named to his first team.&nbsp;After six seasons with his local club, he will join PSG in September 2022.&nbsp;In an interview, he revealed that his decision was motivated by his dissatisfaction that his former team did not provide him with the lifetime contract offer he had hoped for.</p><p>Valencia supporters blamed Marchena for his leaving and made disparaging and nasty remarks about her.&nbsp;In response to the remarks she got, Soler said that the disgusting messages with insults demonstrate that we continue to live in a macho culture that must be changed since it is causing a lot of harm.</p><h2>Soler dedicated a goal in a 7-0 win against Costa Rica to Marchena</h2><p>Soler was called up by Luis Henrique for the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Doha, Qatar. He came in as a substitute for Spain in their first game against Costa Rica and demonstrated his presence was worthwhile. Pedri scored in the 90th minute after being substituted in the 57th minute in a thrilling 7-0 triumph against Costa Rica.&nbsp;Soler dedicated the goal to Marchena and full-back Jose Luis Gaya, who was forced to leave Spain’s camp before the game began.</p><p>He also said that he felt at ease and certain that everything would go smoothly due to how they had prepared themselves. They wanted a powerful, intense start, speed on the ball, goals, and a quick turnaround, but the outcome was even better, he continued.&nbsp;Soler’s dedication to Marchena is not the first time he has done so, but he has done it multiple times previously by drawing the letter “M” with his fingers in joy.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Marta-Marchena-2.jpg alt="Marta Marchena" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>She formerly dated singer Antonio Jose Marchena</h2><p>Jose began dating Marchena a year after winning the international talent contest in 2015.&nbsp;The pair dated for five years before deciding to divorce.&nbsp;Jose discussed his heartbreaking separation from Marchena on Toni Moreno’s show “Dejate Querer,” adding he is now alone and whole.&nbsp;While asked whether he is romantic when in a relationship, he responded it depends on the day, the time he finds himself, or what the other person gets to bring out of him.</p><p>Because he said that he is square, it must be the one who keeps him away from anything that screws him up.&nbsp;In addition, he said that his heart had been crushed “in the greatest manner possible.”&nbsp;“Fenix,” his fifth album, is about his breakup, and he has put his emotions into the songs.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Her net worth is still being calculated. We now know how much her lover, Carlos Soler, is worth. Soler agreed to a five-year deal with PSG for a cost of €18 million, with a possible increase of €3 million. His current net worth is reported to be approximately $10 million as of December 2023.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqqklnqurdGcn56mkWKurbiMmpmoraRiwamxjKCgq6SWp7amusNmpp9lk5a%2FrbvSZqqopJWnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
