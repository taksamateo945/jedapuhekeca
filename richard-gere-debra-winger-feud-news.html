"The onscreen chemistry between the two of them was terrific, but it was a different story once the camera was turned off," he wrote (<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>via ABC News</a>). They couldn't have stayed farther apart from each other."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/debra-2019-1.jpg><p>During a 2018 appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Winger shared that the Officer and a Gentleman set <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>wasn't her favorite to work on</a>, but not because of Gere.</p><p>"When pigs are involved, when there are bad men running the show, they tend to take the fun out of it," she explained. "Officer and a Gentleman wasn't so much the director [<strong>Taylor Hackford</strong>], but we had bad men running the show and so it kind of dirties the water."</p><p class=p1><strong>RELATED: For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/debra-wwhl.png><p>Winger has said on more than on occasion that she and Gere are on good terms now and have a sense of humor about their past tension.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p class=p1>"I run in to Richard Gere quite a lot and he half jokes: 'Are you still saying terrible things about me?'" she told The Guardian. "We had a moment in our life which was not good, but everyone has to get it into perspective."</p><p>The actor shared a similar anecdote on Watch What Happens Live. "I did run into him lately, about a year ago at the Guggenheim," Winger said. "He said, 'Do you still say [expletive] things about me?' And I said, 'I never said [expletive] things about you,' which I probably did, but I didn't mean 'em. And so then we laughed."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/winger-gere.jpg><p>In 2011, Gere received a lifetime achievement award at the Rome Film Festival, which was <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>presented to him by Winger</a>. She thanked him for "all his kindnesses over the years" and called him a "great human citizen of the world."</p><p>Gere <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>mentioned the award</a> and their reunion in an interview with Film Festival Traveler in 2012. "I hadn't seen her in a long, long time. It was nice to see her there," he said.</p><p>He also complimented her as an actor. "She has a really interesting quality," he said. "It's very hard to be as kind of open and unguarded and nice. You know, a nice person and kind of a genuine person and true heart on camera. That's not an easy thing to do. She's able to pull that off. I could never be that way. I was too complicated. There were too many things going on. Just the straightforward presence is an extremely difficult thing to do."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Julia Roberts Called This Co-Star "Completely Disgusting."</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmq6GTna6zsIygnKudXZmyo77AZq6ippeav26yxK6bZqaVrMBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
