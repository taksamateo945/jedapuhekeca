The teacher’s union is asking the district for enhanced benefits and equity improvements for BIPOC teachers.
“We as a district have had a problem both recruiting and retaining our BIPOC educators and our students. That’s something that we want to improve upon. So, today’s session opened up about ways that we think we can help address some of those issues and concerns,” DPS teacher Valerie Henderson said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s about people’s bias towards BIPOC teachers,” DPS social studies teacher Kevin Adams said.</p><p>Adams says another issue that’s impacting the district’s ability to keep teachers of all backgrounds is benefits.</p><p>“I think for educators, we want to make sure that people can afford healthcare,” Adams said.</p><p>DCTA is also asking for continued designated COVID-19 sick leave.</p><p>In a statement to Denver7 regarding negotiations, DPS Director of Talent Edwin Hudson said, “Denver Public Schools is pleased to be at the table with DCTA, as we have been with our other bargaining units, and we look forward to reaching an agreement with our teachers.”</p><p>Negotiations will continue through Wednesday.</p><p>xfbml : true, version : 'v2.9' }); }; (function(d, s, id){ var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;} js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"; js.async = true; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlJq7t7HRZquemZOdsrO%2FjK6loqeeYrGqv9OroJysXaGyorDEq6pmppWcvLW1wK2gp59do7K4ecKopa2qkZjBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
