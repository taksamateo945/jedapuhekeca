Check out what the young actor had to say!</p><p>During their chat, Gaten shared his personal reaction to the script for the upcoming season with the host and it’s safe to say it was enough to give excited fans chills!</p><p>That being said, as far as he is concerned, the next instalment of the series is bound to be the most thrilling yet!</p><p>About filming for Stranger Things after the set was shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gaten said:</p><p>‘We’re getting back,’ before he mentioned that number 4 might just be the scariest season in the series at this point.</p><p>‘Oh, yeah! That’s the one thing I’ve noticed. I was reading it and I am like, ‘They are going for it this year, that is pretty cool!”</p><p>In the same interview, the 18 year old also revealed that he got a job at a local restaurant over the summer since shooting for Stranger Things was put on hold.</p><p>Not only that but he also tried his best to not be recognized, putting on a disguise that sometimes failed because some fans still knew who he was.</p><p>‘People would just look at me for a second, squint…and be like, ‘Are you Gaten Matarazzo?”</p><p>He told the host that some of the fans who recognized him were really young – as young as 3 years old: ‘Like, toddler people! There’re toddlers who love Stranger Things, they think it is like the bomb dot com.’</p><p></p><p>But what about the new season? Will it be accessible to be watched by such young audiences?</p><p>‘I don’t know if the toddlers are gonna enjoy it as much.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>While at this point, not much is known about season 4, Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer stated in February of last year that ‘We’re excited to confirm production on Stranger Things four is underway now – and even more excited to announce the return of Hopper! Although it is not all good news for our ‘American’; he’s imprisoned far from home in the snowy wasteland of Kamchatka, where he’ll face dangers both human…and other.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeXlsGmuoymmK2ZopbHu7uMrZyaq5WoerSxwKymp2VkYrynedKtqZqml5q%2FbsDHoqWgq12eu266xLBkoqakmr%2B3tcSwZG1wZGZ9eHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
