Quite the opposite, in fact. In an interview with <a href=#>The Doctors</a>' Dr. Rachael Ross this week, the Full House alum hinted that she and her husband of 18 years, former NHL player <strong>Valeri Bure</strong>, have a very active sex life.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have to schedule time together. But the other part is making sure that we stay connected sexually," the actress, 38, said of how they keep the romance alive even with three kids underfoot. "That's a very fulfilling part of a marriage. When you're happy sexually, it kinda just balances the rest of the stuff out. You're not so mad at each other, you're not nit-picking at the little things."</p><p>(Another one of Bure's relationship strategies, as detailed in her book, Balancing It All: My Story of Juggling Priorities and Purpose, is to take on a submissive role in her marriage. "It is meekness, it is not weakness," she previously explained on HuffPost Live. "It is strength under control, it is bridled strength.")</p><p>The DWTS third-place finisher also spoke with Dr. Ross about the importance of physical fitness in her life. "I have found that I'm a much happier person, I'm awake longer, I have more energy when I'm being physical, when I'm exercising," she explained. "My clothes feel better, I feel prettier, my skin radiates."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Prioritizing is key, too, as is learning to be happy with yourself and your life, regardless of outside opinion. "I think that, as women, we need to stop comparing ourselves and let that go," she said. "Because my life is gonna look different than your life, and your life is gonna look different than the next woman's life."</p><p>"It's like, if you're a stay-at-home mom with kids or you're homeschooling, do it, and do it really well," she continued. "Invest in the things that you are led to invest in. That creates a natural balance."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqappSWsKZ5wpqknqqfo3qjwdGeZKyska7Abq%2FOp6Wem6SasW6%2FxLGsmqScrnq4tdOhZKGdomK1tr%2FBmqWdZWJlfnV9lnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
