There are 17 species of these beautiful <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>birds of the sea</a>, all of which&nbsp;exist exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Penguins also choose the same partner to procreate with season after season. And even though they have no visible ears, they have excellent hearing that they use to find their mates. Truly, they're a wonder, on top of being&nbsp;some of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>cutest creatures</a> in the animal kingdom. Herein, we've gathered the most stunning images of these <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>animals in their natural habitats</a>, from the frosty Arctic Ocean to the sunny shores of South Africa. These gorgeous penguin photos will take your breath away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/king-penguin-mating-couple.jpg><p>King penguins,&nbsp;like the ones pictured here, have the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>longest breeding season</a> of all penguin species, typically lasting 14 to 16 months in total.&nbsp;Once king penguins find their mate, they stick with them, as this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>adorable embrace proves</a>.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=800 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/group-of-king-penguins.jpg alt="Group of King penguins photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>king penguins have fledged fully</a> (meaning that they can swim and have shed their juvenile fluffy brown coat), they leave their colony. The penguins return three years later to breed—and will make this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pilgrimage</a> numerous times throughout their 20 or more years in the wild.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=800 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/african-penguin-swimming.jpg alt="african penguin swimming photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>African penguins (like the one pictured here) are the only penguin species found in South Africa. Since&nbsp;their habitat can get quite warm, they spend most of their days <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>cooling off</a> in the water.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>African penguins</a>&nbsp;can dive to a depth of nearly 330 feet in a matter of 50 seconds—and can stay underwater without oxygen for as long as two and a half minutes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/group-of-king-penguins.jpg><p>The most abundant species of penguin in Antarctica is the chinstrap penguin (pictured here), named after the black band that sits beneath their throats.</p><p>What is perhaps most impressive about this species, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>National Geographic</a>, is the sheer size of their colonies. The largest chinstrap penguin colony is on the uninhabited South Sandwich island of&nbsp;Zavodovski, where an astounding 1.2 million breeding pairs live.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=748 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/king-penguins-in-falkland-islands.jpg alt="King penguins in falkland islands photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>The Falkland Islands</a> are home to more penguins than people, making it a truly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>magical destination</a>.</p><p>This remote South Atlantic archipelago hosts king penguins (pictured here), along with very&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>rare penguin species</a>, including rockhopper penguins, gentoo penguins, Magellanic penguins, and macaroni penguins.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=800 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/group-of-emperor-penguin-chicks.jpg alt="group of emperor penguin chicks photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>These <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>emperor penguin chicks</a>, huddled together for warmth, are referred to as a&nbsp;crèche. As the chicks age, their parents <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>feel more comfortable</a> leaving them on their own in these groups.</p><p>According to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>National Geographic</a>, crèches are a typical sight during late autumn and early winter months when the penguin parents have to gather food. Then, around December, when the warmer temperatures break up the ice that the chicks have been resting on, the youngsters are ready to venture out into the open waters.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=621 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/king-penguins-st-andrews-bay-south-georgia.jpg alt="king penguins st. andrew's bay south georgia photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Famous for being the final resting place of famed explorer <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>Ernest Shackleton</strong></a>, the remote island of South Georgia in the South Atlantic is also famous for its large population of king penguins.</p><p>Despite remaining close to the Antarctic Convergence, the waters surrounding St. Andrews Bay in South Georgia <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>never freeze</a>. That means the penguins don't have to migrate during the winter, which is&nbsp;why St. Andrews' shores are always packed full of king penguins, as you can see here.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=800 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/emperor-penguin-with-baby-chick.jpg alt="Emperor penguin with baby chick photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>After a female emperor penguin lays a single egg, she'll then leave to go catch food for her family. The male penguin will protect the egg for the approximate <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>65 days it takes to hatch</a>, keeping it warm with his "brood pouch," or warm layer of feathered skin near his feet. Then, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>National Geographic</a>, right after the chick is born, the mother returns with enough food to feed her family. Could this proud penguin photo be any sweeter?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/african-penguin-swimming.jpg><p>When they're traveling long distances, you'll often see penguins sliding across the ice on their bellies, like this emperor penguin at the Snow Hill colony in the Weddell Sea of Antarctica. Since penguins are only able to waddle with their short legs and webbed feet, this stomach slide, which is called <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>tobogganing</a>, is&nbsp;a faster, more efficient, and easier way for them to travel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/penguins-on-iceberg-in-antarctica.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Gentoo penguins</a>, who have orange beaks and dwell in Antarctica, form particularly long-lasting bonds, even <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sharing parenting responsibilities</a> as soon as the female gentoo lays an egg. These two adorable gentoos are right out of a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>cinematic love story</a>—standing on a rock, looking at each other, and holding wings.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=800 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/adelie-penguins-jumping-off-iceberg-in-antarctica.jpg alt="adelie penguins jumping off iceberg in antarctica photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Adélie penguins</a> are native to the coasts of Antarctica, and are named after the wife of French explorer&nbsp;<strong>Jules Dumont d'Urville</strong>, who first discovered this species of penguin back in 1840.</p><p>Unlike other species of penguin, the&nbsp;Adélie, which are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>particularly small</a>, are objects of prey for leopard seals, giant petrels, and occasionally, even <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>killer whales</a>. But these&nbsp;Adélie penguins jumping in the water don't seem scared.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=800 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/emperor-penguin-parents-and-their-chicks.jpg alt="Emperor penguin parents and their chick photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Both the mother and father emperor penguin dedicate their existence to providing food and shelter for their newborn, according to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Australian Antarctic Division</a>.

Unlike other species of penguins, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Fiordland Crested penguin</a> is shy and timid in nature.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=695 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/magellanic-penguins-in-chile.jpg alt="Magellanic penguins in chile photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Named after the explorer <strong>Ferdinand Magellan</strong>, who first discovered this species of penguin back in the 16th century, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Magellanic penguins</a> are known for the distinctive white band that loops around each of their eyes and meets at their chins. These penguins live in the southernmost parts of South America&nbsp;and in the Falkland Islands.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=635 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/wild-african-penguins.jpg alt="wild african penguins photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>African penguins are equipped to deal with rising temperatures due to their habitat. They lack feathers on their legs and have patches on their faces that allow any excess heat to escape—keeping them cool constantly.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1200 height=800 title=Shutterstock src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/emperor-penguin-feeding-its-chick.jpg alt="Emperor penguin feeding its chick photos of wild penguins" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>After traveling upwards of 125 miles to find a plentiful amount of food for her newborn, a female emperor penguin must locate her mate and child back home at the colony. According to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>PBS</a>, the female penguin has a unique call that she lets out to find her partner so that the family can be reunited successfully.
