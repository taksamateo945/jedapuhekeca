According to a TMZ report, the reason Sanchez and Longoria broke off their brief relationship was a rocky start to the 2012 NFL season. 
Sources connected to the former couple tell us ... they broke up because Mark was impossible for Eva to be around because he was in such a crappy mood over the NY Jets' horrible season."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Players are very much affected by what takes place on the field.&nbsp;</p><p>This season hasn't been the smoothest for the Jets quarterback. In fact, it's been pretty tumultuous for all involved.&nbsp;</p><p>While the team is off to a 3-4 start, Sanchez has been hit with the usual criticism he has suffered in previous season. Only this time, there is a fan-favorite QB in <a href=#>Tim Tebow</a> in the bullpen.&nbsp;</p><p>While there is no guarantee that this would add more pressure to each Sanchez start, it certainly can't help matters.&nbsp;</p><p>On the year, Sanchez&nbsp;has seven interceptions, four fumbles and a&nbsp;74.6 QB rating. While he does have 1,453 yards thrown on the season, his completion rate,&nbsp;53.2 percent, is the lowest of his career.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not the worst news in the world, but it's clear the season has given enough reason to make a top-tier athlete rather crabby.&nbsp;</p><p>Never say Sanchez doesn't care about the games, because, according to the report, it just cost him a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Follow me on Twitter for more swaggy swag.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGxwZG2DdnnNsmSjnaSoeqLDxa6jZquVlsCwuoyrnKmnoqmypXnRnpisp55is7C%2BjKaYq6NdqK6vr8eesWaZnpl6psLAZqOoppekv6qtjKynpaGk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
