Jordan was followed in the top five by first runner-up Miss Texas <strong>Ylianna Guerra</strong>, second runner-up Miss Rhode Island <strong>Anea Garcia</strong>, third runner-up Miss Nevada <strong>Brittany McGowan</strong>, and fourth runner-up Miss Maryland <strong>Mamé Adjei</strong>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The competition was famously full of controversy thanks to co-owner <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump</strong>‘s headline-making words</a> about Mexican immigrants as he campaigns for the GOP nomination for President in the 2016 election. Trump’s choice to label these immigrants as “rapists” and drug pushers inspired NBC and Univision to drop the pageant, and moved scheduled talent — from judges to performers to hosts — to pull out of the gig.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the slew of troubles for the pageant, Jordan looked as thrilled as could be with her win. She grinned as her name was announced, appearing awestruck when Sanchez placed the tiara on her head of blonde curls. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGamoaOoera%2FwGZpaWllYrqqv9JmpqSkkZ28rq2MqKOirpmWequ70Z2Yp2Wnnru0edOhnGaboqTEr3mRaWhuaWJs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
