Cooks fills their need for a No. 2 wide receiver next to CeeDee Lamb. Michael Gallup was a disappointment in 2022, though he could improve next season now that he is more than one full year removed from a torn ACL.</p><p>Even before they brought in Cooks, the Cowboys made <a href=# rel=noopener>one of the best trades</a> of the offseason by acquiring Stephon Gilmore from the Indianapolis Colts for a 2023 fifth-round draft pick.</p><p>Gilmore and Trevon Diggs give Dallas' secondary two high-end starting cornerbacks for defensive coordinator Dan Quinn to utilize alongside a pass rush led by Micah Parsons.</p><p>The Philadelphia Eagles won the NFC East last season with a 14-3 record, but there's an argument to be made they have gotten worse this offseason. Javon Hargrave, C.J. Gardner-Johnson, T.J. Edwards, Miles Sanders, Isaac Seumalo and Kyzir White are among the key players they have lost in free agency.</p><p>The Cowboys haven't lost anyone of great significance and brought in two starters at premium positions in Cooks and Gilmore. They are certainly well set up to challenge the Eagles for the top spot in the division in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZm6CdH6MnKawmp%2BuwG6%2B1Kamq6tdl7%2BiusOipWabn6S4tHnRnqqtqqWYwba%2BxKxknKeeqb%2Bir9NmmJ%2Bslad6tb7AnZxmnqKkum7AxLGYp6s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
