She has filed a lawsuit. The suit alleges that Dwayne was targeted and drugged in a blackmail and robbery conspiracy.

Kalabrya is suing the four individuals for battery and the establishments for negligence, claiming they allowed patrons to use drugs and drug other patrons, including her late husband.</p><p>The lawsuit alleges that the dump truck driver who hit Dwayne, Oriel Patino, was driving carelessly and above the speed limit. In addition, the truck’s owner, Pedro Sinecio Diaz, is accused of failing to repair the truck’s brakes and tires properly. Haskins died on April 9, 2022, after being struck by a dump truck on a Florida highway.</p><p>Also, the lawsuit alleges that his highly-expensive watch was stolen from him shortly before his death.</p><p>The suit has been filed in <a href=# title="Def Leppard Drummer Rick Allen Injured in Unprovoked Attack Outside Florida Hotel">Florida by personal injury attorney</a> Rick Ellsley on behalf of Haskins’ widow and parents. The suit also names the Wyndham Garden Hotel in Boca Raton, Florida, and the three establishments Dwayne had visited before his death: Drive Shack in Palm Beach, Florida; the Blue Anchor Pub in Delray Beach, Florida; and E11Even nightclub in Miami.</p><p>Attorney Rick Ellsley released a statement saying the lawsuit is “an important step in the process of uncovering the complete truth about this tragedy.”</p><p>The Florida Department of Transportation is also named in the lawsuit, claiming they obstructed visibility with a construction sign and didn’t properly maintain the lighting or lower the speed limit where Haskins was hit. The lawsuit also alleges that the rental car company, Roam Rental Car of Miami, rented Haskins a mechanically damaged car, leading to him running out of gas.</p><p>According to a Broward County Medical Examiner’s Office investigation report, Dwayne had been on foot on the roadway after his rental car had run out of gas. The report also revealed that the QB had “drank heavily” and ingested ketamine in the hours before his passing. His blood alcohol level was .24 at the time of the accident.</p><p>The details surrounding the death of <a href=# title="Drew Brees- The Former NFL Quarterback’s Biography">former NFL quarterback</a> Dwayne Haskins remain murky. However, the civil <a href=# title="Former model files lawsuit accusing Miramax executive of rape and sues Disney">lawsuit filed</a> by his widow aims to shed light on the events leading up to his tragic death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo6%2FRoquim6NjsLC5jqecsKtfmcSixc2eZKGZo6C2r7%2BMsJisZZSnwqizxJ1kq6eSl7KlecCnm2aanJawrLnAoqOenF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
