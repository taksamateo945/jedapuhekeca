Either in a good way or bad.</p><p>From provocative fashion to controversial performances and stage invasions. Let’s look back at the craziest top 10 moments in the MTV VMAs history (because what else can you expect when you get the world’s biggest stars in the same room?).</p><h4>1. Bass Guitar Attacks Nirvana’s guitarist Krist Novoselic (1992)</h4><p><strong>What happened?:</strong> Nothing special or extraordinary. Just an ordinary guy, from not a very well-known band called Nirvana, threw his bass guitar in the air during performance of “Lithium” , which accidentally landed right on his head.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHWX3pCSEpU</p><p>(4:15-4:33)</p><p>Don’t try this at home, kids!</p><h4>2. Courney Love crashes Madonna’s interview (1995)</h4><p><strong>What happened?:</strong> Basically, Courtney Love decided to crash a live post VMA interview between Madonna and Kurt Loder. AWKWARD.</p><p><br>“ Courtney Love is in dire need of attention right now” OUCH</p><h4>3.&nbsp;Rage Against the Machine VS Limp Bizkit (2000)</h4><p><strong>What happened?:</strong> Looks like Kanye West wasn’t the first stage invader at the MTV VMAs. At the 2000 event, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford was so distressed that his band lost the Best Rock Video award, he climbed up a fake palm tree onstage and began to rock back and forth. Yes, that’s exactly what happened…</p><p><br>Just in case you’re wondering what happened to Tim, well… He got arrested and ended his night in jail.</p><h4>3. Fiona Apple: “This world is bullshit” (1997)</h4><p><strong>What happened?:</strong> It was probably one of those days for Fiona when she was too lazy to do something. So, she decided to write her speech the last minute. Unfortunately, more interesting things got in the way and…</p><p></p><h4></h4><h4>5. Michael Jackson accepts imaginary award (2002)</h4><p><strong>What happened?:</strong> Looks like even the best of the best fail sometimes. Britney Spears’ birthday wishes to Michael Jackson turned into one of the most awkward moments in all of VMA history when The King of Pop thought he was accepting an Artist of the Millennium trophy and launched into a heartfelt thank-you speech.</p><p></p><h4>6. Madonna makes out with Britney Spears</h4><p><strong>What happened?:</strong> In the middle of their performance Madonna surprised everyone by kissing Britney Spears.</p><p></p><p>We’re not sure what’s more entertaining Madonna and Britney’s kiss or Justin’s face (0:17)</p><h4>7. Britney fails her comeback performance (2007)</h4><p><strong>What happened?:</strong> 2007 was not a good year for Britney Spears, and her comeback performance at the VMAs is a perfect proof. Spears mimed to her song, seemed confused and disoriented on stage and appeared to have forgotten the lyrics and dance moves to her performance.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1lhv_IOkIs</p><h4>8. Lil Mama crashes “Empire State of Mind”(2009)</h4><p><strong>What happened?:</strong> Lil Mama decided to be part of the show when Jay-Z and Alicia Keys performed their chart-topping “Empire State of Mind” and joined them on stage.</p><p></p><h4>9. Lady Gaga’s meat dress (2010)</h4><p><strong>What happened?:</strong> At the 2010 MTV Music Video Awards, Lady Gaga wore a dress made of raw beef which according to Gaga was a statement about one’s need to fight for what one believes in.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/imagesmtv-a.akamaihd.net/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lady-gaga-meat-2-1440794946.jpg alt="Vaizdo rezultatas pagal užklaus? „lady gaga meat dress“" width=409 height=619 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h4>10.
