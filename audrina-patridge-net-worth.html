She was born on May 9, 1985 in Los Angeles. Her mother is Lynn and her father is Mark. She is the oldest of four kids. She grew up in the city of Yorba Linda. Most of her life was perfectly normal as she grew up in Southern California. She spent a great deal of time at the beach, hanging out with her friends and going to school. There was nothing about her childhood that was significant or much different than that of anyone else, but she ended up becoming a famous reality television star when she graduated from high school. It was all because she decided to move to LA and attend school while she worked on pursuing her dream career.</p><p>It was 2006 when Audrina Patridge first became famous. She was first just a friend of a friend of Lauren Conrad, the girl who came from Laguna Beach to attend fashion school. Producers moved Audrina Patridge around to different companies to ‘work’ while they filmed, and she was friends with the girl rooming with Conrad. Her name is Heidi Montag, and she was allegedly a good friend of Conrad at the time. Audrina later became Conrad’s roommate as she and her friend Heidi began to drift apart thanks to the boy that was dating Montag. She became a more permanent fixture on the show, and that’s when people began to learn who Audrina Patridge really was.</p><p>There was a time in 2009 when she was supposed to have her own reality show, but it did not work out for her. She appeared on The Hills more than anyone else that was ever on the show, and she eventually landed a role in a made-for-television movie that launched her minor acting career. She’s since worked on commercials, been a spokesperson for PETA, and she’s worked on her career by dancing on reality television. Since 2008, she’s been dating BMX dirt bike rider Corey Bohan. The couple became engaged just before Thanksgiving in 2015. A month later, just before Christmas, it was announced that they were expecting their first child together.</p><p>So far there have been no wedding plans that we aware of, but it is suspected that Audrina Patridge will give birth early in the summer of 2016. She has not said what she will do about continuing to pursue her career in television once she becomes a mother, but she will likely choose to spend some time with her new baby, reportedly a girl, before she decides to do anything. With a few roles in small movies, a few commercials and hosting jobs to her name, it appears that she does have a career in television if she can continue to find work once she becomes a mother for the first time. Audrina Patridge has a bright future ahead of her, and she’s a name people already recognize as being famous.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiYrpyinruiec%2Baq6uhlJyybrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
