Although their current membership count is unknown, they have already recruited the Vigilante Group Hunters and Super Sumo, as well as secretly contacting several S-Rank heroes. It remains unclear why people trust this new group, but Genos’s inclusion might provide some insight into their inner workings. However, since Saitama is his master, Genos is unlikely to join unless Saitama asks him to. Nonetheless, this presents a golden opportunity for all heroes to join their cause and make a difference.</p><h2><strong>Where to read One Punch Man Latest Manga Chapter</strong></h2><p>On Tonarinoyj, you can read the series’ past releases in raw format as well as the upcoming One Punch Man Chapter 185. You can access the Viz Media website and app to read in English, but the most recent chapter isn’t there, so you’ll have to wait till Chapter 185 is available.</p><h2 id=h-one-punch-man-chapter-184-summary><strong>One Punch Man Chapter 184 Summary</strong></h2><p>The battle between Tatsumaki and Saitama finally ended, with Saitama being the clear winner. Tatsumaki, however, didn’t want to concede easily and tried to launch Saitama into space. Unfortunately, she only managed to lift him a few feet off the ground before she began bleeding from her head and passed out due to the strain. Saitama woke her up and was irritated when Tatsumaki said she would try another surprise test once she heals.</p><p>Fubuki arrived on the scene and expressed her desire to fight Tatsumaki, but she changed her mind about her subordinates. Eventually, things resolved between the Psychic Sisters, and Fubuki collaborated with Mr. McCoy to cover up the events. To do this, they scattered parts of monster carcasses around the battlefield and claimed that Tatsumaki singlehandedly repelled a pack of Demon-level monsters that attacked the Hero Association HQ. Since the cameras were offline, no one could refute their claim, and Tatsumaki’s ratings went up.</p><p>As a result of the increased publicity, Tatsumaki landed a commercial gig to recruit potential heroes, which turned out to be a hit. However, she wasn’t happy that they had used AI to alter the footage and make her look “cute.” Additionally, there appears to be a new organization secretly recruiting heroes to establish a new Hero Association, but no other details are known about it yet. It seems that they have already recruited a sizable army of newer generation heroes.</p><p>Read More:&nbsp;Chainsaw Man Chapter 128: The Emergence of a New Chainsaw Man</p><p>One Punch Man Chapter 183 Reveals Shocking Traitor: Gearspur’s Storyline and Implications</p><p>Infinite Mage Chapter 34 Raw Scan, Spoilers, Release Date</p><p>Get the latest from Sportslumo.com by following us on&nbsp;Instagram,&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;YouTube</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnn6OybrzUp5qhZZ2Wu265wKeemmWTna6xwMSrZGpwZWK%2FprjEmqqeZZSWwaZ50qmmoqSVp8Burc2dZLCglaeybsDOZqmemZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
