According to the US Attorney’s Office’s case against Jen Shah, the reality TV personality used telemarketing schemes to swindle a large number of individuals throughout the country.&nbsp;According to the charges, Jen Shah and her co-conspirator Stuart Smith cheated their victims, the majority of them were above the age of 55. She allegedly offered consultant lists of bogus business prospects to individuals. According to the accusations, Shah may have been engaged in telemarketing fraud since 2012.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jen-Shah-3.jpg alt="Jen Shah" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Following the allegations filed against her, Shah may face up to 30 years in jail for conspiracy to launder money. She might also face up to 20 years in jail for the fraudulent accusations leveled against her.&nbsp;Smith, Shah’s assistant, has also pled guilty to the allegations. In all, the TV personality may face up to 14 years in jail, a $16 million fine, and restitution for the money duped. The penalties are estimated to be roughly $6.5 million, with restitution of up to $9.5 million possible. The formal date for the sentencing hearing has been established on November 28.</p><p>Jen Shah was questioned about her criminal activity in court, according to Inner City Press’ Matthew Russel. She responded:</p><p>“Wire fraud, providing services of little or no value.” We communicated through interstate phone calls and emails. I was aware that many of the buyers were over the age of 55. I sincerely apologize.”</p><p>Meanwhile, US Attorney Audrey Strauss issued a news statement in which she stated:</p><p>“In truth, and as stated, the so-called business possibilities pushed on victims by Shah, Smith, and their co-conspirators were just fraudulent schemes driven by a desire to steal victims’ money.” These individuals now face jail terms for their alleged offenses.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jen-Shah-4.jpg alt="Jen Shah" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Jen Shah Case Judgement</h2><p>Jen Shah and her co-conspirators allegedly scammed their victims for $5 million, according to the claims. In August of last year, a judge denied Shah’s plea to dismiss the case, indicating that Manhattan prosecutors had enough evidence to prosecute and punish Shah in a trial.</p><p></p><p>The 48-year-old is now free on a $1 million bond, which was established in April. She had pled not guilty to the allegations against her at the time. It remains to be known what type of jail term the reality TV star will receive after her trial judgment in November.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jen Shah</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Television personality</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqZdqLWitIywmKxllqTCr7CMoKyipKSuerC6jJ%2BcnZ2ilrlur86upa2rXaSzbq%2FOp5uum6Seu6h5wGarnqSVoq6zt8StoKefXZu%2FosHDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
