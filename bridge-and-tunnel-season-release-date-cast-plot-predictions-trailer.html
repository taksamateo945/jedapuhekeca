The series, which is anchored in the 1980s, is a series of recent adult graduates who go to Manhattan to live their <a href=#>dreams</a> while still trying to keep in touch with the little town of Long Island, from which they originally originated.</p><p>At EPIX in early 2021, the show wrapped up its first season, and those who saw the show are anxious to find out when and whether it will return for a second season.</p><p>The first season consisted of only six episodes and culminated in a finale that left many of the show’s features dealing with the consequences of changing life decisions. While “Bridge and Tunnel” did not end up on the Cliffhanger, it left its enthusiastic fans, and many now want to know when a second season will come.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Bridge and Tunnel Canceled For Season 3?</h2><p>After two seasons, the 1980s-themed dramedy by Edward Burns has been canceled by Epic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bridge and Tunnel Season 2 Release Date: When will it release?</h2><p>The bridge and tunnel for a second season must be renewed officially by EPIX, so there’s no official release date. As Rotten Tomatoes shows, the show was not very much loved by the critical community. Still, its limited episode count and reality could mean that production costs were relatively low, which is good for the future. They can also quietly cancel the show without an official word coming down one way or the other.</p><p>Since the first season began in early 2021, “Bridge and Tunnel” is probably not returned with its second season until 2022. The number of episodes for which it can be renewed if it is returned is also unclear. Depending on the network’s feeling, it can be another limited run of about six episodes, or it can be longer or shorter. It’s all up in the air, however, until we hear that the show was renovated.</p><p>On Epix on July 10, the second season of Edward Burns’ rom-com Bridge and Tunnel will air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bridge-and-tunnel-release-date.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bridge and Tunnel Season 2 Cast: Who will be the Cast?</h2><p>As the show wasn’t renewed, no information was made about who exactly would be in the cast for a second season. All major actors, including Sam Vartholomeos, Caitlin Stasey, Gigi Zumbado. Jan Luis Castellanos, Brian Muller, and Isabella Farrell, would return from the very first season.</p><p>Whereas all of these actors play solid roles, no one is such a big star that a possible second season is impossible to sign them. Although the main cast will all come back, some shows start to cast fresh talent in their second season. In the second season, “Bridge and Tunnel,” they could introduce new faces to its cast. But the core ensemble would probably remain.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bridge-and-tunnel-cast.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bridge and Tunnel Season 2 Trailer: When will it be out?</h2><p>We expect the trailer of Bridge and Tunnel Season 2 will be more likely to be out in the mid months of 2022.
