We have been moving it quite a bit to test it with both PS4 and PC, and it never felt like it was about to fall apart.</p><p>That being said, the S2721HGF’s minimalistic design is mostly matte black plastic. The monitor clip-on base is hexagonal in shape, and measures only 9-inches, leaving plenty of space on your desk for other elements of your gaming setup.</p><p>It is also very easy to assemble, and it took us only a couple of minutes to snap the two parts together.</p><p>On the back, the monitor has a handy cutout in the stand for cable management.</p><p>In terms of ergonomics, the S2721HGF allows for a height adjustment of up to 5 inches (12.8,8).</p><p>It cannot switch between portrait and landscape and has no swivel function, but it does offer a tilt range feature allowing the screen to be tilted upward by 21 degrees and downward by -5 degrees.</p><p>We found this to be enough to satisfy our personal gaming needs, but we can see how some players may want to have more flexibility in this regard.</p><h3>Connectivity</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-03-02-16.19.03.jpg><ul><li><strong>Dell S2721HGF monitor, £199 on Amazon – <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>As far as connectivity is concerned, the Dell S2721HGF offers two HDMI 1.4 ports, one DisplayPort 1.2, and an audio line-out jack for your headphones.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ports are located underneath the vent, on the monitor’s right side, making them a little tricky to access.</p><p>As in most monitors in this category, there are no USB ports in Dell’s S2721HGF, but this goes to show how Dell cut several potential features to keep the price of this monitor under £200.</p><p>The S2721HGF comes with an HMDI cable in the box, so you won’t have to worry about buying one separately.</p><h3>Performance and Settings</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/be53c2f8-364d-415b-89cc-90fd884fae9c.jpg><p>A gaming monitor through and through, the Dell S2721HGF offers a 144 Hz refresh rate and a fast 1 ms response time, which is perfect for online competitive games like Counter-Strike, Overwatch, and Rocket League, but also for graphics-heavy offline games like CyberPunk.</p><p>For context, the minimum for modern, casual gaming is 60 Hz, but most gaming monitors today offer at least 120 Hz.</p><p>The S2721HGF’s 144 Hz refresh rate, combined with a fast response time and a great colour accuracy will enable you to enjoy fast-action games to the fullest, eliminating motion blur and creating a truly immersive experience.</p><p>This monitor also offers a multitude of settings. We recommend the Standard preset for most games, as the others may result in somehow unnatural colours.</p><p>Feel free to experiment, however, as the S2721HGF really packs in a lot of options when it comes to colour presets.</p><p>This flexibility is certainly a plus, and it shows particularly in bright games like Fortnite, or ones where a particular colour is preponderant on screen, like FIFA.</p><p>From the settings, you can also turn AMD FreeSync Premium on and off, and regulate Response Time. Generally speaking, it’s good to turn these settings on whenever you are playing, but you most likely won’t need them when using the monitor for work.</p><p>But it’s time to address the elephant in the room. The S2721HGF is a 27-inch monitor with a 1080p resolution. Does that detract from the gaming experience? The answer is both yes and no.</p><p>Keeping the resolution at 1080p is necessary for the S2721HGF to achieve its high refresh rate and quick response time, while also keeping the price of the monitor in check.</p><p>You can get monitors with better specs and resolution, but you’ll have to spend substantially more.</p><p>A full-HD resolution is not top-notch in 2021, as many of them today are quad-HD or 4K, but it still delivers solid and clear graphics, thanks to the S2721HGF’s performant specs.</p><h3>The Verdict</h3><ul><li><strong>Dell S2721HGF monitor, £199 on Amazon – <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>All in all, the Dell S2721HGF offers a good compromise between price and performance, and for most gamers that will be enough.</p><p>This minimalistic monitor packs in a lot of tech, and shines particularly for its multitude of settings, high refresh rate, and sturdy built.</p><p>It is perfect for online competitive gaming, but also for single-player, story-driven ones, if you don’t mind the full-HD resolution (as opposed to quad-HD or 4K).</p><p>If you do, however, and have the budget for a more ergonomic monitor, or one with a better resolution, you should definitely check out the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Dell S3220DGF</a> and the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Razer Raptor 27</a>.</p><p>And if you are on a tighter budget, you may want to have a look at cheaper options like the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Asus VP228HE</a> and the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">LG UltraGear 24GL600F..</a></p><p>Still, all in all, the Dell S2721HGF represents one of the best gaming screens currently available on the market under the £200 mark.</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VT-Comp-best-silk-pillowcase.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">Smooth Operators</h3><p>Best silk pillowcases 2021: hypoallergenic pillowcases to keep skin fresh</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Simba-Hybrid-www.simbasleep.com-2-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="teaser-slug__copy t-p-background-color">Review</span></p><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">Sleep Tight</h3><p>Simba Hybrid Mattress Review – Plus save 30% until April 26</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000647367709.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">IN A SPIN</h3><p>Best cheap microwaves for every budget</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tm-comp-Hoops-off-landscape.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">SPINNING AROUND</h3><p>Where to buy the best weighted hula hoops for core workouts</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hozelock-main-pic-e1556177507857.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">UNDER PRESSURE</h3><p>The best garden hosepipes 2021 to buy ahead of this summer</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472617927.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">KING OF THE GRILL</h3><p>6 best gas BBQs you can buy in time for summer 2021</p><p>Did you enjoy our review of the Dell S2721HGF monitor?
