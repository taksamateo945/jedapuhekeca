The Suljkanovic family suffered devastatingly from the landmines in the area after the family’s father, Muhamed, lost both his feet. The family was overjoyed to meet Diana, who celebrated Muhamed’s birthday with the Suljkanovics. After hearing she had died only a few weeks after meeting her, they named their newborn daughter after her. “They saw we have to somehow remember good people, and we remember her like that,” Muhamed said.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tooJ%2BserG%2ByKeanqujYrGqrc2aZKmtpGK1pr6MpaCfnV2WwW6%2ByKyiZqWVp7Juuc6nq6GrXZeyp7vRnmSsoJVisaqxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
